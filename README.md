This is a prototype tool for editing YAML i18n strings.

You have 2 files.
The reference file is the version of the file you want to be translated
and the target file is the translation you want to produce.
You load both of these files into the tool and it generates an interface for you to do the translation.

Press save at any time to download a modified version of the target file with any changes made to it.
Send that file back to whoever asked you to translate it.

## Background

I made this repo to play around with [alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/),
[css variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
